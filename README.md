# Group Maker

A commandline tool for making groups.

Uses Node's [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) to communicate with the terminal.

Plan to use [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) in the future.

## Local Usage

Run locally: `node index.js`

Or install as a local node module:

`cd` into the directory

`npm install -g`

then you can run the tool using `groupz` in the terminal

(remember: you'll need to reinstall every time you make a change)
